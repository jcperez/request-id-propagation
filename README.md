## Overview

This implementation shows how to propagate a piece of information (e.g. a request id) and have that value available during the entire request lifecycle.

This is very useful, because we can identify all the log entries that belong to an specific request when handling concurrent requests, without having to pass down these values to every function we call.

This solution uses [cls-hooked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cls-hooked) which only runs on Node >= 8.2.1. For Node version < 8 is recommended to use [continuation-local-storage](https://github.com/othiym23/node-continuation-local-storage)
